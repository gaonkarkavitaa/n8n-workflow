# n8n-workflow
This n8n workflow reads contact information from a Google Sheet and sends personalized emails to each individual. It uses the Schedule Trigger to run the automation, fetches rows using the Google Sheets node, loops through each entry, and sends customized emails using dynamic variables like Name, Company, and CustomMessage.
